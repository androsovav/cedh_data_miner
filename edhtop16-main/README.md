## How to Contribute
After cloning this repository, contact Jason for instructions on building the database. Becasue we rely on external APIs, our database update scripts don't work as-is. We're working on a script to pull form the EDHTop16 main database.

### Start Backend
`npm install` in [`server/`](/server/) to install packages.
`npm start`   in [`server/`](/server/)

### Start Frontend
Same as starting backend, but in [`client/`](/client/).

When submitting pull requests, please inform us if you've added any new packages and update the corresponding package lock files.
